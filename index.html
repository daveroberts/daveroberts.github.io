  <h1>On Ageism</h1>

<div class="date">October 14, 2017</div>
<div class="post-content">
  
<p>There are quite a few blog posts and writings about ageism in the tech industry.  Generally these articles say the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Once I turned 35/45/55 years old, I was fired and couldn't find another job.</li>
  <li>I'm rejected from jobs because I'm <em>"not a good culture fit"</em> or I'm <em>"overqualified"</em>.</li>
  <li>This is ageism.  Ageism sucks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually the comments to these blog posts are filled with anecdotes saying, <em>"Me too".</em>  At the time I'm writing this post I am 35 years old and haven't yet fallen victim to ageism.  I wanted to post my opinion which brings up a few points which I rarely see discussed in ageism threads:</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.7em">1. Ageism claims (usually) can't be disproven</p>
<p>Let's say 55 year old Walter goes for a job interview at ABC company.  He dresses well, feels he answers all of the questions correctly.  A week later Walt gets a form letter: "We've decided not to move forward with a job offer at this time"</p>
<p>Walt is upset and can't remember answering any questions wrong.  He asks ABC company why he was rejected.  They give a vague answer: <em>"We didn't think that you'd be a good fit for this position"</em>.</p>
<p><em>"This is an obvious case of ageism"</em>, Walt thinks to himself.</p>
<p>Is it?  The answer is no, because Walter is a made-up person.  Just kidding.  The answer is that Walter can claim this is ageism, and we can't prove Walt right or wrong.</p>
<p>When someone is either fired or not hired, the employer doesn't (usually) have to give a reason.  Many jobs are "at-will" employment, where an employee can be dismissed without warning or just cause.  "No-hire" decisions are usually very vague, which is the same as not giving a reason. <a id="footnote-back-1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Here's a common interview question I would give when conducting interviews: <em>How would you handle a situation where X-Y-Z happens.</em>  I'm looking for three things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Correct.  Even when there's no right or wrong answer, there are certain basics that I look for.</li>
  <li>Terse.  Take as long as you need to answer.  But have everything you say be of value.</li>
  <li>Has this candidate <em>actually</em> been in this situation?</li>
</ol>
<p>Too often, the answer would:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Miss some obvious basics.  <strong>"Website is down, what do you do first?"</strong>  <em>"Umm, run our unit test suite?"</em></li>
<li>Ramble on.  Sometimes candidates don't stop talking and keep repeating the same points.</li>
  <li>Sounds memorized from a textbook.  There's nothing wrong with a textbook answer, but if I ask for details and you can't give them, you probably never actually faced situation X-Y-Z.</li>
</ol>
<p>With open ended questions, you get all sorts of answers.  Some good, some bad, and some terrible.  Open ended questions are at least partially subjective, so giving a justification for why you prefer candidate A to candidate B, in concrete objective terms is tough.</p>
<p>After listening to an answer, I move on to the next question.  Walter might ask, "Was my answer correct?"  Even then, I won't give feedback.  I'll be vague and say, "I'm just looking to see how you've handled these types of situations before".  Walt, who doesn't get any feedback, could be forgiven for assuming his answer was perfectly correct.</p>
<p>After the interview, at least one interviewer was responsible for writing up the hire or no-hire reason.  I always hated writing no-hire reasons.  It is easier (and lazier) to write "not enough experience with XYZ systems" than the more concrete and truthful "Candidate was unable to answer basic questions about SQL.  Answers to situational questions were not focused and didn't show that the candidate had much experience with systems in the cloud".</p>
<p>Because Walt either gets no response or a vague response, he may correctly assume that the real reason is hidden from him.  However, even if the real reason is hidden, it doesn't mean that ageism is the real reason.  It might be, but Walt will never know. <a id="footnote-back-2" class="footnote" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.7em">2. Ageism can be used as a scapegoat</p>
<p>Let's assume Walt isn't that good of a programmer and knows the interview didn't go well.  Let's also assume that ABC company gave a vague no-hire justification like, "Not a good fit".  It might be easier for Walt to believe that he is a victim of ageism, not that he's a below average programmer.  Even if Walt's honest with himself, it might be easier for him to tell his family that ageism was the reason he was rejected.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.7em">3. Discrimination has a cost</p>
<p>If ABC company is unwilling to hire programmers over 35/45/55, then it is putting itself at a disadvantage.  One cost is that ABC might be missing out on hiring some great programmers.  ABC is artificially lowering the supply of programmers to hire, which raises the cost to hire programmers.  Assuming ABC is an ageist company, they will have to pay more to hire only younger programmers. <a id="footnote-back-3" class="footnote" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>You may be thinking, <em>"But that's not true, younger programmers work for less money."</em>  In that case, I would suggest that candidate wage was more important than candidate age to the hiring company.  This leads into my final point:</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.7em">4. Older programmers make more money</p>
<p>Older people generally make more money than younger people through experience and raises.  Companies almost always ask candidates how much money they make (or how much money they want to make).  A company looking to cut costs may opt to hire lower paid programmers, who also happen to be younger people.</p>
<p>Generally older people have more debt and will look at jobs which pay more to help pay off their debt.  Older people generally have more expenses too.  They may not be willing or able to accept jobs for under a certain amount of money. <a id="footnote-back-4" class="footnote" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>All else being equal, if Walter is looking for a job, but won't consider jobs that pay less than a certain amount, his chances of being hired are lower than a candidate who's willing to work at any salary.</p>
<p>If a company prefers to hire employees who work for less money, is this ageism?  I don't know, but it's not a variable which companies ignore in their hiring decisions.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My heart goes out to programmers whenever I read about them losing thier jobs or not being able to find work.  I'm 35, and I haven't been personally affected by ageism (yet).  However, I hope that the claims of ageism are overstated, and programmers don't have a natural expiration date, and I'll be able to work as long as I would like to.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
  <h1>Footnotes</h1>
  <div>
    <div><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-back-1">[1]</a> I'm not a lawyer.  I'm pretty certain there are some cases where justification is required for termination and not hiring candidates.  At a company where I worked it was required to internally report a reason for no-hire decisions.  I'm not sure if this was a legal requirement, or if the candidate ever saw the reason which we gave.  Certain reasons were not allowed or accepted, such as "not a good fit".  You also were not allowed to cite compensation as a reason: "He's good, but we expect more out of a candidate who costs $200K/year".  You also couldn't cite anything that you learned about the candidate outside of the interview.  For example, for internal hires you were allowed to talk to the employees co-workers, but anything they said couldn't be used in justification reason for a no-hire.</div>
    <div><a id="footnote-2" href="#footnote-back-2">[2]</a> It's usually claimed that ageism is an unconscious bias, so it would be impossible for even the interviewers themselves to know ageism was the root cause if this were true.</div>
    <div><a id="footnote-3" href="#footnote-back-3">[3]</a> The silver lining to ageism is that as long as companies are paying a premium to hire younger programmers, you can hire more experienced programmers for less money.  This applies to any type of discrimination.</div>
    <div><a id="footnote-4" href="#footnote-back-4">[4]</a> People usually counter this point by saying that more experienced programmers are worth the cost.  I'm not disputing that they can be worth the cost.  Often times the best programmers are worth a premium.  However, if you're a company looking at two candidates who are both qualified, and one costs $100K and the other costs $130K, the salary difference can't be ignored.</div>

<p>Being able to communicate well is second only to your ability to write good code as a developer.  It takes a lot of work to get right, and getting it right is really important.  Here are my tips.</p>
<p><strong>1. Be nice</strong></p>
<p>Sounds easy, right?  It is, but I'm amazed at how often people send angry emails.</p>
<p>Emails are forever.  Don't let anger, which is usually a temporary emotion, leak into your emails.  If you need to, go take a walk and cool down before you hit send.  A good friend once told me <strong><i>"Don't document negativity"</i></strong>.</p>
<p>You may want to side-step this rule by writing polite emails which are insults in disguise.  For example, <i>"Thank you for finally resolving this"</i>, or <i>"I think you've helped all that you can!"</i>.  Don't do this either.</p>
<p><strong>2. Be brief</strong></p>
<p>People skim their emails, so be terse.  If a long explanation is warranted, consider putting a one line summary at the top.</p>
<p>Write an email draft and then refine and trim it until the email contains just the bare essentials.</p>
<p><em>People love graphs.</em>  I've known managers who said, "I spend most of my day in Outlook!".  That sounds incredibly boring to me.  Most emails are just text you don't want to read.  Including a picture in your email will make it stand out.  Also, some people are visual learners, and pictures just work better for them.  A picture can be worth a thousand words.</p>
<p>Let's say that at 9AM you receive an email saying that the server was slow the night before at 8PM.  As a developer, the first thing I'll do is download the log files from the night before.  Log messages are usually pretty uniform, so it's trivial to write some code that reads a log file and spits out a CSV with event type and timestamp.  Throw your CSV into Excel and it'll make you a pretty graph:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/good-emails/frequency.png" alt="frequency chart" /></p>
<p>Now I can send an email which says, <i>"We're looking into this issue.  It appears that the numbers spiked at 8:11PM and then declined."</i></p>
<p>Even though graphs are easy to make, people always assume I spend hours creating them.  (I always get asked either how I made the graph or how long it took to make them)  They also assume that if I'm spending time creating graphs, I'm taking their problem seriously and not writing it off.  By creating a graph, you're quantifying what may have initially been a subjective problem (the app feels slow).  You're confirming the problem report as accurate, and shown that you have a way to measure the problem.  People will think that you're well on your way to a solution, even if you haven't fired up your IDE yet.</p>
<p>I rarely regret taking the time to make graphs.  I strongly recommend it.</p>
<p><strong>3. If you expect action, make it painfully clear</strong></p>
<p>Here's a good example of a concise email:</p>
<p><i>
  From: Me<br />
Subject: Feature-x ready for testing<br />
Dear team,<br />
We have developed feature-x and it is ready for testing.  Feature-x allows our software to import Word files.  Jim, can you check out brach-feature-x and test it?  Let us know if it contains bugs or if it is working as expected.
</i></p>
<p>If the email is addressed to multiple people, be sure to name who you want to take the action.  If you don't know who should do the work you can say, <i>"Test leader Sally, please ask a member of your team to . . ."</i>  If you ask "can somebody test this?", you're less likely to get a result.</p>
<p>Bonus points if you can put the request in the first line.  More bonus points if the email is one line.</p>
<p>As a corollary to this rule, if you don't expect anybody to take action, reconsider whether an email is needed at all.</p>
<p>However, "No action" emails can be useful as a paper trail.  If somebody says, "You never told me!", you can simply point to the email you sent earlier.</p>
<p>Leaving your phone number in your signature is also a good idea.  Some people don't like writing emails.  If someone calls you and prefers to talk, talk with them.  Don't "force" them to write email.  Of course, phone calls don't leave a nice paper trail.  After the call, send an email to everybody on the email chain, including the person that called you.  Here's an example:</p>
<p><i>
  From: me<br />
I wanted to keep you all in the loop on a conversation John and I just had where we discussed &lt;topic&gt;.  Some of the key points are A, B, and C.  I agreed to do X and he agreed to do Y.  I will follow up when X is complete.
</i></p>
<p>Sending this email keeps everyone up to date, preserves the paper trail, and perhaps most importantly, let's John confirm that what he meant to say to you on the phone is what you heard.</p>
<p><strong>4. Read through your emails before you send them</strong></p>
<p>I'm amazed at how bad some of my emails are before they're proof read.  I generally keep re-reading an email until I get through it without making any changes.  If the email is going to VIPs or a bunch of people, you can even ask for another person to read it for you first.  This has the added benefit of subtly complimenting the person that you value their opinion and input on important matters.</p>
<p><strong>5. Replies should empower the sender</strong></p>
<p>When you receive an email, it's usually because the sender is trying to accomplish some task, and needs your help.  Make sure your reply empowers them to complete their task.  Here's an example email.</p>
<p><i>From: Customer<br />
Dear development team,<br />
We're receiving reports that the software is not working this morning.  Please look into this right away.</i></p>
<p>What the customer is actually saying:</p>
<p><i>Dear development team,<br />
My boss has gotten over 50 emails from pissed off users that our software is broken.  He's breathing down my neck demanding answers.  Help!</i></p>
<p>Here's a bad way to handle the situation</p>
<p><i>From: Developer<br />
Dear Customer,<br />
This problem might be occurring because a user sent too much data, or the operations team was performing an upgrade (Monday night is normally when upgrades occur, which we've repeatedly warned was a bad time).  The upload module is very complex.  It's possible that it's actually working fine, and the user doesn't understand how the software should behave.  I've attached a copy of our user manual.  We should probably discuss some of the edge cases for upload which weren't specified before.<br />
Signed, Not-our-problem</i></p>
<p>Okay, that's probably over the top, but this is based on a true story.  You haven't empowered the customer to do anything to help fix his/her situation.  Here's a better way to handle that same situation:</p>
<p><i>From: Developer<br />
Dear Customer,<br />
We don't know why this is happening.  We are looking into this and will get back to you this morning.<br />
Signed, &lt;name&gt;<br />
Desk: &lt;number&gt;</i></p>
<p>Saying "I don't know" is a perfectly cromulent response.  Here's an example of a good follow up:</p>
<p><i>From: Developer<br />
Dear Customer,<br />
We looked into the incident.  At 7:30PM last night, our software was reporting two dots, where normally, there is only one dot.  The root cause of this was a user uploading 400TB of data at 5:02PM that same day.  We understand having two dots is not desirable, as it adversely affects how the app performs.  At 9:25AM today, we logged into the server and manually reduced the number of dots to one.  In the short term, we will periodically log into the server and check how many dots are present.  We can prevent this from happening in the future by either restricting how much data is uploaded, or setting up a second server to handle the load.  We can prepare this software change with the upcomming software release planned on the 31st, or prepare an emergency patch which can be deployed on Thursday at the earliest with one hour of downtime to the application.  Please let us know which option you would prefer, or give us a call if you'd like to discuss further.<br />
Signed, &lt;name&gt;</i></p>
<p>You don't have to apologize, but you can if you feel it's appropriate.  The email is informative, direct and honest.  With this type of response, your customer is now <em>empowered</em> to answer all the questions he/she is receiving.</p>
<p>You can be a great developer, but if you're not effective at communicating, you will likely be viewed as a poor developer.  Take the time to write good emails, and it will pay in dividends.</p>
