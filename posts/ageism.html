        <h1>On Ageism</h1>

<div class="date">October 14, 2017</div>
<div class="post-content">
  
<p>There are quite a few blog posts and writings about ageism in the tech industry.  Generally these articles say the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Once I turned 35/45/55 years old, I was fired and couldn't find another job.</li>
  <li>I'm rejected from jobs because I'm <em>"not a good culture fit"</em> or I'm <em>"overqualified"</em>.</li>
  <li>This is ageism.  Ageism sucks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually the comments to these blog posts are filled with anecdotes saying, <em>"Me too".</em>  At the time I'm writing this post I am 35 years old and haven't yet fallen victim to ageism.  I wanted to post my opinion which brings up a few points which I rarely see discussed in ageism threads:</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.7em">1. Ageism claims (usually) can't be disproven</p>
<p>Let's say 55 year old Walter goes for a job interview at ABC company.  He dresses well, feels he answers all of the questions correctly.  A week later Walt gets a form letter: "We've decided not to move forward with a job offer at this time"</p>
<p>Walt is upset and can't remember answering any questions wrong.  He asks ABC company why he was rejected.  They give a vague answer: <em>"We didn't think that you'd be a good fit for this position"</em>.</p>
<p><em>"This is an obvious case of ageism"</em>, Walt thinks to himself.</p>
<p>Is it?  The answer is no, because Walter is a made-up person.  Just kidding.  The answer is that Walter can claim this is ageism, and we can't prove Walt right or wrong.</p>
<p>When someone is either fired or not hired, the employer doesn't (usually) have to give a reason.  Many jobs are "at-will" employment, where an employee can be dismissed without warning or just cause.  "No-hire" decisions are usually very vague, which is the same as not giving a reason. <a id="footnote-back-1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Here's a common interview question I would give when conducting interviews: <em>How would you handle a situation where X-Y-Z happens.</em>  I'm looking for three things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Correct.  Even when there's no right or wrong answer, there are certain basics that I look for.</li>
  <li>Terse.  Take as long as you need to answer.  But have everything you say be of value.</li>
  <li>Has this candidate <em>actually</em> been in this situation?</li>
</ol>
<p>Too often, the answer would:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Miss some obvious basics.  <strong>"Website is down, what do you do first?"</strong>  <em>"Umm, run our unit test suite?"</em></li>
<li>Ramble on.  Sometimes candidates don't stop talking and keep repeating the same points.</li>
  <li>Sounds memorized from a textbook.  There's nothing wrong with a textbook answer, but if I ask for details and you can't give them, you probably never actually faced situation X-Y-Z.</li>
</ol>
<p>With open ended questions, you get all sorts of answers.  Some good, some bad, and some terrible.  Open ended questions are at least partially subjective, so giving a justification for why you prefer candidate A to candidate B, in concrete objective terms is tough.</p>
<p>After listening to an answer, I move on to the next question.  Walter might ask, "Was my answer correct?"  Even then, I won't give feedback.  I'll be vague and say, "I'm just looking to see how you've handled these types of situations before".  Walt, who doesn't get any feedback, could be forgiven for assuming his answer was perfectly correct.</p>
<p>After the interview, at least one interviewer was responsible for writing up the hire or no-hire reason.  I always hated writing no-hire reasons.  It is easier (and lazier) to write "not enough experience with XYZ systems" than the more concrete and truthful "Candidate was unable to answer basic questions about SQL.  Answers to situational questions were not focused and didn't show that the candidate had much experience with systems in the cloud".</p>
<p>Because Walt either gets no response or a vague response, he may correctly assume that the real reason is hidden from him.  However, even if the real reason is hidden, it doesn't mean that ageism is the real reason.  It might be, but Walt will never know. <a id="footnote-back-2" class="footnote" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.7em">2. Ageism can be used as a scapegoat</p>
<p>Let's assume Walt isn't that good of a programmer and knows the interview didn't go well.  Let's also assume that ABC company gave a vague no-hire justification like, "Not a good fit".  It might be easier for Walt to believe that he is a victim of ageism, not that he's a below average programmer.  Even if Walt's honest with himself, it might be easier for him to tell his family that ageism was the reason he was rejected.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.7em">3. Discrimination has a cost</p>
<p>If ABC company is unwilling to hire programmers over 35/45/55, then it is putting itself at a disadvantage.  One cost is that ABC might be missing out on hiring some great programmers.  ABC is artificially lowering the supply of programmers to hire, which raises the cost to hire programmers.  Assuming ABC is an ageist company, they will have to pay more to hire only younger programmers. <a id="footnote-back-3" class="footnote" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>You may be thinking, <em>"But that's not true, younger programmers work for less money."</em>  In that case, I would suggest that candidate wage was more important than candidate age to the hiring company.  This leads into my final point:</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.7em">4. Older programmers make more money</p>
<p>Older people generally make more money than younger people through experience and raises.  Companies almost always ask candidates how much money they make (or how much money they want to make).  A company looking to cut costs may opt to hire lower paid programmers, who also happen to be younger people.</p>
<p>Generally older people have more debt and will look at jobs which pay more to help pay off their debt.  Older people generally have more expenses too.  They may not be willing or able to accept jobs for under a certain amount of money. <a id="footnote-back-4" class="footnote" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>All else being equal, if Walter is looking for a job, but won't consider jobs that pay less than a certain amount, his chances of being hired are lower than a candidate who's willing to work at any salary.</p>
<p>If a company prefers to hire employees who work for less money, is this ageism?  I don't know, but it's not a variable which companies ignore in their hiring decisions.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My heart goes out to programmers whenever I read about them losing thier jobs or not being able to find work.  I'm 35, and I haven't been personally affected by ageism (yet).  However, I hope that the claims of ageism are overstated, and programmers don't have a natural expiration date, and I'll be able to work as long as I would like to.</p>

  <h1>Footnotes</h1>
  <div>
    <div><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-back-1">[1]</a> I'm not a lawyer.  I'm pretty certain there are some cases where justification is required for termination and not hiring candidates.  At a company where I worked it was required to internally report a reason for no-hire decisions.  I'm not sure if this was a legal requirement, or if the candidate ever saw the reason which we gave.  Certain reasons were not allowed or accepted, such as "not a good fit".  You also were not allowed to cite compensation as a reason: "He's good, but we expect more out of a candidate who costs $200K/year".  You also couldn't cite anything that you learned about the candidate outside of the interview.  For example, for internal hires you were allowed to talk to the employees co-workers, but anything they said couldn't be used in justification reason for a no-hire.</div>
    <div><a id="footnote-2" href="#footnote-back-2">[2]</a> It's usually claimed that ageism is an unconscious bias, so it would be impossible for even the interviewers themselves to know ageism was the root cause if this were true.</div>
    <div><a id="footnote-3" href="#footnote-back-3">[3]</a> The silver lining to ageism is that as long as companies are paying a premium to hire younger programmers, you can hire more experienced programmers for less money.  This applies to any type of discrimination.</div>
    <div><a id="footnote-4" href="#footnote-back-4">[4]</a> People usually counter this point by saying that more experienced programmers are worth the cost.  I'm not disputing that they can be worth the cost.  Often times the best programmers are worth a premium.  However, if you're a company looking at two candidates who are both qualified, and one costs $100K and the other costs $130K, the salary difference can't be ignored.</div>
